"""
This class simply controls who the opponent is during training.

The opponent is reselected at the start of each episode based on the
 agent's win rate. The opponent is chosen as the agent who has the best
 win rate against the training agent, although there are some exploratory
 games to check agents who we haven't played against very often before.

More possible opponents are added to the pool as the agent trains - old
 versions of the agent are added.

        an opponent.

        we play against an opponent, the uncertainty in our loss rate goes down by
        1/sqrt(number of times we played them). We choose the next opponent as the
        one with the highest loss rate + 1/sqrt(number) correction, to choose highly
